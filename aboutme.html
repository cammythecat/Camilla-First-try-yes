	<p id="aboutmetekst">Hi, I'm Camilla Jacobsen.
	I'm a multimediadesign student with a passion for digital art, graphics and game design. 

	I started playing videogames with my father at a very young 
	age, maybe around 5 or 6. He would always let me control either reload or jump when we played tomb raider on the pc. Of course we played other videogames but I remember this so clearly and I'm positive, that this is one of the main reasons, why I love videogames today.  

	I've loved the digital world ever since I got my computer at a young age, but I didn't really start it seriously until I started both playing games by my self and got my very first drawing tablet. I got a hold of a free drawing software and from there on after, I was hooked!

	I love a very diverse array of genres in both art and games. I really enjoy horror and gore but I equally enjoy cute and cozy, zen and relaxed. 

	When I'm not drawing, painting, gaming or the likes, then I enjoy spending time with my family. 

	My partner of almost a century, Mathias, and I enjoy the small things and slow living life. He's just as much of a geek as myself. Together we have a wonderful daughter, Ravna, who has been giving our life new dimensions. I can't wait to introduce her to the many different hobbies and activities I enjoy myself. </p>
